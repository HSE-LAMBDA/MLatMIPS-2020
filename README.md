# MLatMIPS-2020

**Welcome to the Machine Learning part of the course!**

For the practical part we are going to use Google Colab. In order to be able to use it, please make sure you have a google account.

## Introductory part:
 - [Introduction to python](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HSE-LAMBDA/MLatMIPS-2020/blob/master/Introduction/01-Welcome.ipynb)
 - [Introduction to numpy, pandas and matplotlib with the Titanic dataset](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HSE-LAMBDA/MLatMIPS-2020/blob/master/Introduction/02-Libraries.ipynb)

## Linear models:

At the seminar we'll go through the following two notebooks:
 - [ML basics with linear models](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HSE-LAMBDA/MLatMIPS-2020/blob/master/Seminar/1_LinearModels_ToyData.ipynb)
 - [Working with LHCb data for particle identification](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HSE-LAMBDA/MLatMIPS-2020/blob/master/Seminar/2_LinearModels_LHCb_PID.ipynb)


## Pytorch:

At the seminar we'll go through the pytorch basics:
